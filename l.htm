<p><b>Before Combat </b>Leeara uses her <i>rust bag of tricks</i>, pulling out
two animals and placing them in the room as guardians
before she hides behind one of the canvases hanging
from the northern wall.</p>
<p><b>During Combat </b>Leeara makes a sneak attack
from hiding as soon as she can-if she
can't make the attack on a surprise
round, she takes advantage of her
animal minions to flank the PCs,
preferring to use Spring Attack to
make sneak attacks in this way while
preventing enemies the luxury of
gaining a full-round attack action against her
in melee.</p>
<p><b>Morale </b>Leeara attempts to flee into
the wild if reduced to fewer than 15
hit points. She remains in hiding for
several days, eventually sneaking back
into this area to try to reclaim her cave lair,
but by then the grace period for easy removal of
her id mutant template has passed.</p>

</table>

<p><b>Favored Enemy (Animals)
 (Ex)
</b> You gain a +2 bonus on Bluff, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks when using these skills against animals. Likewise, you get a +2 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against such creatures. You may make Knowledge Skill checks untrained to identify such creatures.</p>
<p><b>Evasion
 (Ex)
</b> You can avoid damage from many area-effect attacks. If you make a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, you instead take no damage. Evasion can only be used if you are wearing light armor or no armor. If you are helpless, you do not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
<p><b>Favored Terrain (Urban)
 (Ex)
</b> You gain a +2 bonus on Knowledge (Geography), Perception, Stealth, and Survival checks when using these skills in urban terrain (buildings, streets, and sewers). Likewise, you get a +2 bonus on initiative checks when in this terrain. If you desire, you leave no trail in this terrain and cannot be tracked.</p>
<p><b>Hunting Companions
 (Ex)
</b> You form a powerful band with your companions. You may spend a move action to grant half your favored enemy bonus against a single target to all allies within 30 feet who can see or hear you for 1 rounds. This bonus does not stack with any favored enemy bonuses possessed by your allies; they use whichever bonus is higher.</p>
<p><b>Low-Light Vision
 (Ex)
</b> You can see x2 as far as humans in low illumination. Characters with low-light vision have eyes that are so sensitive to light that they can see twice as far as normal in dim light. Low-Light Vision is color vision. A spellcaster with low-light vision can read a scroll as long as even the tiniest candle flame is next to her as a source of light. Characters with low-light vision can see outdoors on a moonlit night as well as they can during the day.</p>
<p><b>Scent
 (Ex)
</b> You can detect approaching enemies, sniff out hidden foes, and track by sense of smell. You can identify familiar odors just as humans do familiar sights. You can detect opponents within 30 feet by sense of smell. If the opponent is upwind, the range increases to 60 feet; if downwind, it drops to 15 feet. Strong scents, such as smoke or rotting garbage, can be detected at twice the ranges noted above. Overpowering scents, such as skunk musk or troglodyte stench, can be detected at triple normal range. When you detect a scent, the exact location of the source is not revealed--only its presence somewhere within range. You can take a move action to note the direction of the scent. When you are within 5 feet of the source, you pinpoint the source&#39;s location. You can follow tracks by smell, making a Wisdom (or Survival) check to find or follow a track. The typical DC for a fresh trail is 10 (no matter what kind of surface holds the scent). This DC increases or decreases depending on how strong the quarry&#39;s odor is, the number of creatures, and the age of the trail. For each hour that the trail is cold, the DC increases by 2. The ability otherwise follows the rules for the Survival skill. When tracking by scent you ignore the effects of surface conditions and poor visibility.</p>
<p><b>Sneak Attack
 (Ex)
</b> If you can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from your attack, you can strike a vital spot for extra damage. Your attack deals 3d6 points of extra damage anytime your target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC, or when you flank your target. Should you score a critical hit with a sneak attack, this extra damage is not multiplied. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage, you can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. You cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack, not even with the usual -4 penalty. You must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. You cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with concealment.</p>
<p><b>Surprise Attack
 (Ex)
</b> During the surprise round, opponents are always considered flat-footed to you, even if they have acted.</p>
<p><b>Track
 (Ex)
</b> You gain +2 to Survival checks made to follow tracks.</p>
<p><b>Trapfinding
 (Ex)
</b> You add +2 to Perception skill checks made to locate traps and to Disable Device skill checks. You can use the Disable Device skill to disarm magical traps.</p>
<p><b>Trap Sense
 (Ex)
</b> You gain a +1 bonus on Reflex saves made to avoid traps, and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks made by traps.</p>
<p><b>Uncanny Dodge
 (Ex)
</b> You can react to danger before your senses would normally allow you to do so. You cannot be caught flat-footed, nor do you lose your Dexterity bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. You still lose your Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. You can still lose your Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against you.</p>
<p><b>Wild Empathy
 (Ex)
</b> You can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude of a person. You roll 1d20+3 to determine the Wild Empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly. To use Wild Empathy, you and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal circumstances. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute, but as with influencing people, it might take more or less time. You can use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but you take a -4 penalty on the check.</p>
